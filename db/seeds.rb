# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# things.each do |camp|
#   Campground.create(name: camp[:facility_name], state: camp[:state], contract_id: camp[:contract_id],
#     facility_id: camp[:facility_id], latitude: camp[:latitude], longitude: camp[:longitude],
#   amps: true)
#  end
